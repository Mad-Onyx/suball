suggestion:
  
1.Properly configure path of your resolvers file as the scirpt is personal one and contains the path of my local machine 
  so, configure your path accordingly.
  
2.Read the script first and make necessary amends as per your requirement.
  
3.All the tools should be configured and thier path should be exported so that they are accessible from anywhere.
  (also tools like sublist3r requires the full path)
